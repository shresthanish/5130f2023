Consistify is a habit-tracking application designed to foster personal development and wellness. The application employs a two-tier architecture, with the front end crafted using React and Bootstrap v4, providing an intuitive and responsive user interface. The back end is powered by Node.js and MongoDB, delivering a robust and scalable foundation for managing habit-related data. The project is structured to initiate the backend on port 3001 and the frontend on port 3000, allowing for independent startup and seamless communication between the two components. Consistify aims to facilitate users in cultivating positive habits and achieving their personal goals through an accessible and technology-driven platform.
